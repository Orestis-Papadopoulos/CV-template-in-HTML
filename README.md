This is an A4 paper template for a CV. Written in HTML and CSS it allows for great customization. Opening the .html file in a browser and pressing Ctrl + P lets users convert the CV into a .pdf file. The "Print backgrounds" option must be checked in order to include all CSS features in the resulting .pdf file (i.e., the background colors).
